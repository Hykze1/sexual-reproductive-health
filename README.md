### An NGO  has been approached by an international organization called JHG, which is working on sexual reproductive health. They have implemented a program in Congo where they are giving HIV preventive medicine for free to anyone in need. The pill, which we call DP, must be taken daily to be effective. 

### JHG has partnered with clinics across the country, who will be distributing DP pills to patients. The DP comes in packages of 30 pills. Once a month, a patient will need to go back to the clinic and receive a new package. JHG is seeing a much lower uptake and demand for the pills than they had expected. They have concluded that it must be a behavioral problem, since they have made the pills entirely free and easily accessible in hundreds of clinics across the country.

## Our task is to:

a) Provide basic summary statistics of the data. 

b) Create visuals of the received DP and refill variables (received DP, month1, month 2, month 3, and month 6) to give JHG better understanding of continuation rates (i.e., how many times the recipient comes back for a refill of the DP). These refill variables show how long a patient has come back for refills, telling you how long they adhered to DP.

c) Explain what the graphs are telling us about continuation rates and how the rates differ by key variables. 

d) Suggest one intervention/improvement to the problem JHG is facing, referencing the data and any relevant literature on the topic. 

## JHG decides to implement the intervention/improvement you suggested (i.e., from your answer in d on the previous slide). After one year, you see that the number of patients receiving DP has increased by 25% while those continuously refilling DP every month has increased by 30%.

e) Can you say that the intervention/improvement caused the increase in DP use by 25% and continuous use by 30%? Explain why or why not. 

f) Can you tell us what would be a better way (if at all) to assess the effectiveness of your intervention?
